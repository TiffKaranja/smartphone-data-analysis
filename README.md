📱 Smartphone Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting smartphone prices using a variety of features. It's a great beginner-level regression project that touches on all essential steps in a machine learning workflow — from EDA to model evaluation.

🔍 Project Overview
Goal: Predict the price of smartphones based on specifications.

Dataset: Kaggle Smartphone Specifications Dataset.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

💡 Key Objectives
Understand what features affect smartphone prices.

Perform data cleaning and feature engineering.

Train and evaluate regression models.

Interpret model results using feature importance.

🧰 What I Did
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Handled missing values and feature encoding

Created new features like Price_per_GB

Applied feature scaling with StandardScaler

Trained models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost

Compared model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R²

Visualized predictions and feature importance

Documented Q&A learning-style markdown (Section-wise)

📊 Features Used
Some of the main features considered:

RAM, Internal Memory

Battery Capacity, Fast Charging

Processor Speed, Number of Cores

Screen Size, Resolution

Number of Rear/Front Cameras

5G, NFC, IR Blaster Support

🧪 Models Trained
Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

📖 What I Learned
The importance of feature scaling before regression

How to derive insights using feature importance

How model performance changes with different feature sets

Practice with scikit-learn's end-to-end ML pipeline
